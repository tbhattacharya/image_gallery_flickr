    To compile this list, we started with an algorithm that calculates a combination of social and engagement metrics. To avoid the results being merely a popularity contest, the selection also involved curation by Flickr staff.
    
    Where photos from the same community members appeared multiple times in the algorithmic ranking, weâ€™ve selected one of their top-scoring images to represent their work.
